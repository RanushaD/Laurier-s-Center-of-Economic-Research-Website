                        This study examines the effectiveness of Unconventional Monetary Policies (UMP). It considers whether these policies were found to be successful and where the impact remains questionable. We survey the international financial market and macroeconomic effects of UMP both in the economies where these policies were introduced as well as their spillover effects across borders. The paper considers a wider range of UMP rather than the impact of specific policy instruments. We do so by providing a retrospective on the important case of Japan beginning in the later 1990s. We ask whether the Eurozone’s experience with UMP is substantively different, given the structure of policymaking. Finally, we ask if the ‘old normal’ is not in our future, whether the new normal in monetary policy should routinely include the panoply of instruments and interventions that make up what are now referred to as UMP? We conclude that using a wide range of instruments that can prevent economic collapse, but are not designed to promote adequate economic growth, does not appear to be a sound monetary policy strategy. Far better to adopt an effective communication strategy. This might also prevent future policy makers from asking or expecting too much from their central banks.

                        This paper examines the demographic determinants of inflation expectations in South Africa. Five surveys covering the period 2006-2016, and consisting of over 12000 observations were empirically examined using time series, cross-sectional, censored and quantile regressions. We assess whether factors such as gender, income, education, race and age, impact one year ahead inflation expectations. In doing so we uncover clear behavioural biases in how respondents view the inflation outlook. For example, education and income tend to be inversely related to inflation expectations. This is consistent with the literature although we observe significant changes over time that many other surveys are unable to uncover. In addition, it seems that inflation expectations respond to recently observed inflation. Unlike other studies, younger individuals have lower inflation expectations and we conjecture that the adoption of inflation targeting in South Africa played a role. Finally, we find that demographic characteristics interact with communication by the South African Reserve Bank, as well whether inflation is rising or falling. These are two additional novel features of the analysis.

                        This paper examines the monetary policy transmission mechanism in four systemically important economies. The impact of monetary policy is found to be broadly comparable for China, the US, the Eurozone, and Japan. Identifying a role for the financial sector is essential to unpacking various channels through which monetary policy operates. Global factors play a significant role and their impact is strongest for China and weakest for Japan. China’s impact is significant with the Eurozone displaying the most interdependence and Japan the least. Time-varying VARs suggest that contrasts in the responses to monetary policy shocks persist highlighting some of the remaining differences in the transmission mechanism. Finally, there is no apparent structural change in the estimated relationships around the time when the Fed intervened after 2008. It is conjectured that Quantitative Easing may well have prevented such a break.

Finally, we ask: if the ‘old normal’ is not in our future, should the ‘new normal’ in monetary policy routinely include what we now refer to as UMP? We conclude that UMP can prevent economic collapse but are not designed to promote stronger long-term economic growth. Apart from new communication strategies, the use of UMP under normal circumstances does not appear to be a sound monetary policy strategy. Failure to learn this lesson might also prevent future policy makers from asking or expecting too much from their central banks.

                        Despite their ubiquity, tattoos continue to be associated with dishonesty. Yet, scarce behavioral 
                        evidence exists. We test whether the tattooed and non-tattooed differ in their dishonest 
                        reporting in two consecutive incentivized experiments. First, subjects toss a coin privately 
                        five times and receive payment for each heads reported. After, subjects perform five additional 
                        coin tosses with the payment for each heads reported increased tenfold. We find few differences 
                        in the reporting behavior between the tattooed and non-tattooed in the number of heads reported 
                        in either reporting task or the difference between the two. Strategic dishonesty is limited to a 
                        small minority of subjects and to only one additional reported heads in the high-stakes tosses.

                        This study investigates the ways in which the time preferences of older adults with mild cognitive 
                        impairment (MCI) are influenced by their executive cognitive abilities. Within the framework of this

                        Expectant parents experience a variety of emotions, including joy, anticipation as well as anxiety and fear related to the health of the fetus, the delivery and the newborn. These sources of uncertainty and stress render expectant mothers suspectible to the influence of popular beliefs. We design an experiment to evaluate the widespread Israeli belief that a baby’s room should remain unfurnished until after the baby is born. We test the impact of this belief on the economic decisions of pregnant Jewish women in Israel. Our findings show that many pregnant women, especially in the second half of pregnancy, prefer to avoid challenging popular beliefs – even at a financial cost. The negative affective consequences of “tempting fate” lead to a preference for a small monetary amount over new furniture for the newborn. The strength of popular beliefs and its influence on individual choice vary in accordance with ethnic origin and degree of religiosity.

                            businesses in Vietnam. Our data allows us to observe businesses for two surveys prior to
                            obtaining a license and hence to control for differential trends before formalisation. We find that
                            obtaining a license is not associated with an increase in profits or other business outcomes such
                            as revenue, expenses, and employment once we control for differential trends. Controlling for
                            trends is crucial, as estimates that ignore trends consistently find a larger positive association
                            between becoming licensed and business performance. Our results suggest that inducing more
                            businesses to register is unlikely to bring about large-scale changes for these businesses.

                            Chinese futures markets for agricultural commodities are among the fastest growing
                             futures markets in the world and trading behaviour in those markets is perceived as
                             highly speculative. Therefore, we empirically investigate whether speculative activity
                             in Chinese futures markets for agricultural commodities destabilizes futures returns.
                             To capture speculative activity a speculation and a hedging ratio are used. Applying GARCH models we first analyse the influence of both ratios on the conditional volatility of eight heavily traded Chinese futures contracts. Additionally, VAR models
                            in conjunction with Granger causality tests, impulse-response analyses and variance
                             decompositions are used to obtain insight into the lead-lag relationship between speculative activity and returns volatility. For most of the commodities, we find a positive  influence of the speculation ratio on conditional volatility. The results relying on the
                             hedging ratio are inconclusive.

                        This paper examines the macroeconomic implications of exchange rate shocks in a sample of 13
                        emerging market and 6 advanced economies since the early 1990s. Factor-augmented vector
                        autoregressions are estimated with three separate factors identified. They are: real, monetary
                        and financial factors. The main conclusion is that there is no ‘one size fits all’ when interpreting
                        the domestic responses to an exchange rate shock. International policies that aim to define a
                        particular exchange rate or exchange rate regime are unlikely to be able to deal with so many
                        idiosyncratic responses. Nor is it the case that a particular monetary policy strategy, such as
                        inflation targeting, can immunize a domestic economy against all external shocks. International
                        cooperation should instead encourage individual economies to seek out the menu of policies
                        that ensure that each one’s house is in order.

                        The reduction of greenhouse gas emissions from road transport is a key policy goal that is
                        being pursued by both federal and provincial governments using a range of policies. This paper
                        considers the cost of alternative approaches to reducing emissions from road passenger travel
                        in Canada. Our findings reinforce the widely-held belief that a revenue-neutral carbon tax is the
                        most cost-effective tool to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Regulatory instruments on their
                        own, such as a low carbon fuel standard, vehicle greenhouse gas intensity regulation, or zero
                        emission vehicle mandate, achieve a given reduction at much higher cost. We show, however,
                        that a combination of regulatory instruments can better approach the cost-effectiveness of a
                        carbon tax than individual regulations. We provide insight about the optimal combination of
                        regulatory instruments in the Canadian context, and find that both a low carbon fuel standard
                        and an zero emission vehicle mandate can be jointly used to reduce GHG emissions from the
                        transport sector. Our analysis is timely, given the rapidly evolving policies in this sector.

                        Forty percent of Americans under the age of 40 have at least one tattoo. Yet survey and
                        experimental evidence suggests that the tattooed are viewed negatively and may face
                        discrimination in the labor market and in commercial transactions. In view of the potentially
                        adverse economic consequences of a tattoo, the decision to get one may be regarded as shortsighted
                        and impulsive. We collect numerous measures of time preferences and impulsivity of
                        tattooed and non-tattooed subjects and find broad-ranging and robust evidence that those with
                        tattoos, especially visible ones, are more short-sighted and impulsive than the non-tattooed. Almost
                        nothing mitigates these results, neither the motive for the tattoo, nor the time contemplated before
                        getting tattooed, nor the time elapsed since the most recent tattoo. Even the expressed intention to
                        get a(nother) tattoo predicts increased short-sightedness and helps to pin down the direction of
                        causality between tattoos and short-sightedness.

                        Efficient cooperation often requires coordination, such that exactly one of two players takes
                        an available action. If the decisions whether to pursue the action are made simultaneously,
                        then neither or both may acquiesce leading to an inefficient outcome. However,
                        inefficiency may be reduced if players move sequentially. We test this experimentally by
                        introducing repeated two-stage versions of such a game where the action is individually
                        profitable. In one version, players may wait in the first stage to see what their partner did
                        and then coordinate in the second stage. In another version, sequential decision-making is
                        imposed by assigning one player to move in stage one and the other in stage two. Although
                        there are fewer cooperative decisions in the two-stage treatments, we show that overall
                        subjects coordinate better on efficient cooperation and on avoiding both acquiescing. Yet,
                        only some pairs actually achieve higher profits, while the least cooperative pairs do worse
                        in the two-stage games than their single-stage counterparts. For these, rather than
                        facilitating coordination, the additional stage invites attempts to disguise uncooperative
                        play, which are met with punishment.

                        and various countries or regions on these markets and the absence of a so called
                         ‘level playing field’; i.e. the existence of subsidies and other forms of protection 
                         that advantage one nation’s airlines over those of co-signatories to an OSA. We argue 
                         that under an oligopoly market structure, strategic competition brought about by 
                         OSAs creates incentives to subsidize and/or protect domestic airlines. Such incentives 
                         are maintained or amplified by political lobbying efforts that bias civil aviation 
                         policies towards producer interests over wider measures of economic welfare. We report 
                         on financial aid and policies which have co-evolved along with OSAs and which have 
                         advantaged US airlines during the OSA period and which suggest that unlevel playing 
                         fields have been perpetuated and possibly made more unlevel during the era of OSAs.

                        Many countries are adopting austerity measures, whereby governments aggressively
                        raise taxes, with the hope to dispel future solvency crisis. This paper investigates the
                        implications of austerity on the likelihood of solvency crisis. We derive the maximum
                        level of debt consistent with solvency, labelled as the effective fiscal limit on debt, and
                        we show that its position depends on austerity. We find that countries like Italy that
                        undergo strict austerity could lower their effective fiscal limit and induce a solvency
                        crisis in the near future.

									Contrary to the theoretical prediction that CEOs with large debt-based compensation take lower levels of risk, we find that banks with higher CEO inside debt compensation extend syndicated loans with smaller number of lenders, lower spread, less covenant, and higher maturity. Using two-stage selection models, we reconciled these seemingly counter intuitive results of inside debt leads to less conservative loan contracting terms by incorporating banks selection effect. We find that the mechanism of inside debt limit bank risk-taking in loan contracting is through making loans to safer borrowers in the first place, but not through tighter loan terms. These results are consistent and robust to instrumental variables and structure models that control for the endogeneity of relationships.

                        This paper studies the impact of female executives on risk-taking within US banks. An examination of US bank panel data from 2002 to 2010 provides evidence that female executives reduce levels of risk-taking in banks. We also find that a more balanced gender ratio has a greater impact on bank risk-taking than merely with the presence of female executive. The results are robust to alternative specifications of riskiness and instrument variable approach. However, when we only use part of the sample period surrounding the financial crises of 2007-2008, the results do not hold.  We interpret the results as suggesting that having female executives and more balanced gender ratios in the executive team reduces bank risk-taking overall. But the risk-reduction becomes less effective during crisis years.

                        Every country has a fiscal limit on debt, beyond which the country's economic and political systems cannot raise taxes and/or reduce spending sufficiently to maintain solvency. We assume fiscal crises are created by insolvency due to fiscal limits, and use historical data on debt and surpluses to explain why countries with similar
                        debt levels have different crisis experiences. We use values for the maximum historical surplus together with estimates of fiscal feedback rules to estimate debt limits for 
                        each country. Debt limits vary considerably across countries. Defining fiscal space
                        as the largest increase in debt, for a particular surplus, consistent with solvency, we
                        separate countries into risk categories based on fiscal space. Greece and Portugal
                        eroded their fiscal space several years, prior to their fiscal crises, placing them in the
                        highest risk category and predicting the crises that followed. Canada and Belgium
                        maintained large enough fiscal space to achieve safe status. Other countries reduced
                        fiscal space, with three eroding fiscal space in 2014, warning of future crises.

                        We address the health capacity to work among Canadian older workers using two complementary methods, aggregate mortality risk and individual health indicators. We find that men in 2012 would need to work more than five additional years between ages 55-69 to keep pace with how much men in 1976 worked, holding health capacity constant. For working women, the comparable result is only two years more work. Most of these gaps arose before the mid-1990s, as employment advances have offset mortality improvements since then. Regionally, more than half the Ontario-Atlantic employment difference among older men is rooted in health differences.

                        The author found that the rapid growth of capital flowing into commodity markets as they develop into a formal asset class has put downward pressure on the realized volatility of non-energy commodities in the United States. These findings are a result of analysis performed using a difference-in-difference (DID) framework looking into the volatility characteristics of commodities included in the S&P GSCI versus off-index commodities. Additionally, two OLS models directly test the relationship between financialization and realized volatility while controlling for economic and financial fundamentals. Policymakers and regulators should be cognizant of the benefits financial investors (speculators) introduce to commodity markets. These diversified investors improve the ability to distribute risk among market participants, which lowers volatility and risk premiums. Lower risk premiums allow commodity producers and farmers to hedge at higher futures prices. (JEL Q02, G10)

                        Research from intensive, targeted early childhood intervention programs suggests they can have large, long-run private and public benefits, much of which come from reductions in the propensity to engage in criminal activity. That research is being used to advocate for increased government expenditures universal early childhood programs.  However, it is not clear that interventions would have the same effects on the general population as they do on disadvantaged children. The introduction of Quebec’s universally subsidized day care program in 1997 provides an opportunity to take a first glimpse at the long run effects of a non-targeted early childhood program. Studies of the short-run effects of the program show no evidence of improvements in child development in the short run, but the long run effects have not been studied. We use a difference-in-differences strategy to examine the policy’s effects on youth crime rates, using the rest of Canada as the counterfactual.  Overall, we find no evidence of large reductions in youth crime rates among the cohort of Quebec youth following the introduction of subsidized day care relative to youth in the rest of Canada – indeed, if anything, they appear to have increased. We conclude that caution is necessary in using findings of large social benefits of early childhood education from small, intensive, targeted interventions to draw conclusions that larger-scale universal programs implemented in a different context.

                        Cooperation between two players often requires exactly one to take the available action, while the other acquiesces. If the decisions whether to pursue the action are made simultaneously, then neither or both may acquiesce leading to an inefficient outcome. However, inefficiency may be avoided if players move sequentially. We test experimentally whether two-stage versions of this entry-exit game enhance cooperation. In one version, players may wait in the first stage to see what their paired player did and then coordinate in the second stage. In another version, sequential decision-making is imposed by assigning one player to move in stage one and the other player in stage two. Although there are fewer cooperative decisions in the two-stage treatments, we show that subjects coordinate better on efficient cooperation and on avoiding both acquiescing. Consequently they achieve higher profits. Yet, the least cooperative pairs do worse in the two-stage games than their single-stage counterparts. They use the second stage not to facilitate coordination but to disguise their uncooperative play or to punish their opponents.

The positive effect for single mothers is concentrated among divorced mothers, with results suggesting divorced mothers’ likelihood of participating in the labor force rises by 2.8 percentage points when receiving the benefit.  This contrasts with a reduction in the likelihood of legally married mothers participating in the labor force by 1.4 percentage points.  Further, the effects for single moms primarily represent entry to employment and the labor force (extensive margin) and not an increase in hours among those who would have been working without the benefits.  The estimated effects for common-law married mothers and single never-married mothers are not statistically significant.

                         function of the number of consumers who own the same or similar goods. A major obstacle that plagues 
                         the introduction of a network good is the ability to reach critical mass, namely, the minimum number 
                         of buyers required to render purchase worthwhile. This can be likened to a coordination game with 
                         multiple Pareto-ranked equilibria. Through a series of experiments, we study consumers' ability to

                        The global nature of the climate change externality calls for a global response but so far
                         none has emerged. Instead, climate policies are being implemented by subnational and national
                          governments, resulting in a fragmented policy landscape at the national level. This 
                          is certainly the case in Canada. While this outcome is not particularly surprising, 
                          from an economics perspective, it is arguably more costly, less efficient, and 
                          less effective at achieving emissions reductions than a more harmonized approach. 
                          Is this outcome the unavoidable price of Canadian federalism? Is a more harmonized 
                          carbon tax approach feasible? This paper considers Canada’s experience with three 
                          major taxes, jointly occupied by federal and provincial governments. Despite its 
                          highly decentralized structure, Canada has a history of tax harmonization and 
                          coordination arrangements for these taxes. By examining the evolution of these 
                          arrangements, the paper offers insights on the prospects of adopting a more harmonized
                           carbon tax approach to address climate change.

                        Every country has a fiscal limit on debt, where that limit represents a debt level
                        so high that the country's economic and political systems cannot raise taxes or
                        reduce spending sufficiently to maintain solvency. At the limit, creditors flee, and
                        the government faces a fiscal crisis. If we knew the limit, then we could estimate the
                        probability of a fiscal crisis as the probability of reaching the limit. Governments do
                        not announce their fiscal limits. In this paper, we estimate fiscal feedback rules for
                        six-high-debt developed countries to investigate the extent to which the systematic
                        response of the primary surplus to debt reveals information on the fiscal limit. In
                        general, estimation of a fiscal feedback rule does not reveal an explicit fiscal limit for
                        a country that has not experienced a crisis. However, estimates of long-run debt,
                        together with debt history, can be combined to yield an estimate of a lower bound
                        on the fiscal limit. We use estimates of the fiscal rule for six high-debt developed
                        countries to project debt forward from dates, following the beginning of the financial
                        crisis, and compare the projections with our estimates of the lower bound on debt.
                        We label countries, whose debt projections exceed the lower bound as high-risk.
                        Both Greece and Portugal enter the high-risk category about one year prior to their
                        financial crises. Italy is at high risk in 2012 and others are at low risk through 2012.

                        We present the current Italian economic crisis as a phase of a major
                        systemic decline. We argue that “Italy’s system” has forced the
                        country to abandon a “dynamic” view of comparative advantage,
                        crucial for sustained economic growth, in favour of a “static” view
                        of specialization. Creative destruction has been hampered and the
                        indispensable sectoral restructuring has not taken place, leading to
                        stagnation. The roots of this decline lay in collective action issues
                        and an implicit contract between elites and civil society. We suggest
                        that solving these issues is indispensable in order to support a
                        “dynamic” view of comparative advantage and so the re-start of the
                        Italian economy and society.

                        This study examines the gender gaps in average hourly wages facing private sector full time employees in the Canadian provinces, using data from the Canadian Labour Force Survey.  Over the 1997-2014 period, all provinces have made progress toward narrowing the gender wage gap, though notably little progress was made in Newfoundland and Alberta.  Much of the variation across provinces in the gender gap is eliminated once we account for gender differences in individual and job characteristics in each province.  Decomposition results suggest a large portion of the wage gap in each province is explained by gender differences in industry and occupation.  The unexplained portion of the wage gap has been reduced in many provinces as gender differences in industry and occupation play an increasingly important role.

                        had an impact on the volatility of the underlying spot market. To this end,
                        we estimate several Generalized Auto-Regressive Conditional Heteroscedasticity

                        index futures traded in Singapore and Hong Kong. Our results indicate that
                        Chinese index futures decrease spot market volatility in all three spot markets

                        relatively young and largely dominated by private retail investors. Nevertheless,
                        our evidence is favorable to the stabilization hypothesis usually confirmed in

                        This paper examines past evidence of prolonged periods of foreign exchange reserves accumulation in the Asia-Pacific region. Several proxies for this unobserved variable are considered, including a newly proposed one based on a factor model. We focus on identifying periods of prolonged interventions and identify its key macro-financial determinants. Two broad conclusions emerge from the stylized facts and the econometric evidence. First, the best protection against costly reserves accumulation is a more flexible exchange rate. Second, the necessity to accumulate reserves as a bulwark against goods price inflation is misplaced. Instead, there is a strong link between asset price movements and the likelihood of accumulating foreign exchange reserves that are costly. Policy implications are also drawn.

This paper estimates macroeconomic models for Canada to investigate the relationship between changes in non-price lending standards, business loans and output. We ask whether macroeconomic and financial market conditions in the U.S. affect Canadian macroeconomic and financial conditions. The answer seems to be less so than previous evidence suggests. Real time data are also found to have a significant impact on the results. The U.S. and Canada may indeed be likened to ‘two solitudes’ insofar as the impact of credit conditions is concerned. Differences in the quality of banking standards and supervision of financial institutions, as well differences in the effectiveness of monetary policies in the two countries may partially explain the results.

                        This paper extracts measures of monetary policy surprises for Australia, Canada and the United States using a latent factor framework.
                        We distinguish monetary policy surprises which occur when central banks
                        report new assessments of the economy (or do not reinforce changes expected by market assessments) from those when policy makers appear to
                        change their preferences. Changing policy preferences are evident in all
                        jurisdictions, particularly during periods of stress. No-change policy announcements have distinctly differing impacts across the three countries;
                        in Canada these have the same impact as policy changes, in Australia
                        they are not discernibly different to a normal trading day and the US
                        market lies between these scenarios. The revealed differences in size and
                        type of the policy surprise outcomes for these operationally similar central
                        banks suggests that the role of transparency policy is more subtle than
                        previously appreciated.

                        Dividing the burden for greenhouse gas abatement amongst the provinces has proven challenging in Canada, and is a major factor contributing to Canada’s poor historic performance on greenhouse gas abatement. As the country aims to achieve substantial cuts to emissions over the next decade and by mid-century, such burden sharing considerations are likely to be elevated in importance. This paper uses a detailed Canadian computable general equilibrium model to compare a number of archetypal rules for sharing the burden of a joint commitment amongst members for the case of greenhouse gas reductions in Canada. Because of the substantial heterogeneity amongst Canadian provinces, these different burden sharing rules imply significantly different relative abatement effort amongst provinces, and also significantly different welfare implications. We compare these archetypal burden sharing rules to existing provincial emission reduction commitments, and find that none of the standard burden sharing rules comes close to existing commitments. We argue that future efforts to share the burden of greenhouse gas abatement in Canada would be more successful if they were informed by a formal analysis such as the one presented here.

                        We study the effects of an export shock on labor allocation across household businesses and employers in the formal enterprise sector in a low-income country, Vietnam. We find that workers reallocate from household businesses to employers in the formal enterprise sector, with greater reallocation in industries that experience larger declines in U.S. tariffs on Vietnamese exports due to the United States-Vietnam Bilateral Trade Agreement. The reallocation is greater for workers in more internationally integrated provinces and in younger cohorts. Labor productivity of household businesses is relatively low, so our findings suggest this reallocation increases aggregate labor productivity.

                        This study investigates the distributional implications of the revenue-neutral carbon tax policy 
                        in British Columbia. We use a computable general equilibrium (CGE) model of the Canadian economy 
                        and disaggregate households into deciles by annual income using data from a large household 
                        expenditure survey. Using the model, we find that the existing BC carbon tax is highly progressive 
                        even prior to consideration of the revenue recycling scheme, such that the negative impact of the 
                        carbon tax on households with below-median income are smaller than that on households with 
                        above-median income. We show that our finding is a result of welfare effects of a carbon tax 
                        being determined primarily by the source of a households' income rather than by the destination of 
                        its expenditures. Finally, we show that the existing revenue recycling scheme is also progressive. 
                        Overall, the tax appears to be highly progressive.

                        on the allocation of funds among three competing broad categories of
                        expenditures: 1. revenue recycling via tax reductions, 2. support for developing
                         new technologies, and 3. support for adoption of existing technologies.

                        Monetary policies and macroeconomic conditions of large economies often have
                        spillover effects on small open economies (SOEs). Capital control and fixed exchange
                        regimes are sometimes employed to mitigate the spillover effects. In this paper, we use
                        two empirical approaches to study whether the effects of the U.S. monetary policy and
                        output changes on SOEs are moderated by capital control and exchange rate policies.
                        In the first approach, we estimate the responses of output and interest rates of SOEs
                        to U.S. interest rate and output shocks in a VAR framework and relate the estimated
                        responses to capital control and exchange rate regimes. We find evidence that capital
                        controls and fixed exchange rate regimes reduce the spillover effects of such shocks
                        to the SOEs. Secondly, we take a less-structured approach in which we estimate the
                        partial correlation between output and interest rates of SOEs and those in the US in
                        panel regression settings. The results are similar.

                        We provide evidence on the potential for reforms in labour law to reverse deunionization trends by relating an 
                        index of the favorability to unions of Canadian provincial labour relations statutes to changes in provincial 
                        union density rates between 1981 and 2012. The results suggest that shifting every province’s 2012 legal 
                        regime to the most union-friendly possible could raise the national union density by up to 7 percentage points 
                        in the long run. This effect appears driven by regulations related to the certification of new bargaining units, 
                        the negotiation of first contracts and the recruitment of replacement workers. The effects of reform are largest 
                        for women, particularly university-educated women employed as professionals in public services. 
                        Overall, the results suggest a limited potential for labour relations reforms to address growing
                         concerns about labour market inequality.

                        We exploit a quasi-experiment in the province of Alberta, Canada, to identify how changes
                        in the schedule of medical benefits affected the provision of primary care services to patients
                        with multiple co-morbidities. Specically, Alberta introduced a new fee code to compensate
                        physicians for completing a comprehensive annual care plan (CACP) for qualifying patients.
                        During the period of study, primary care physicians could practice in two settings: (i) solo
                        practice; or (ii) primary care networks (i.e., team based care). This paper asks how the policy
                        change affected physician-billing patterns and whether delivery structure affected physician-
                        billing.
                        <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Data come from Alberta's administrative physician claims data, covering the full population
                        of Alberta and all services provided by primary care physicians, for one year before and two
                        years after the policy change. We employ a difference-in-differences methodology and implement
                        a set of robustness checks to control for confounding from other contemporaneous changes that
                        may have occurred in Alberta as well as unobserved physician heterogeneity.
                        <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our results suggest the new fee code became the sixth most billed code in its first year
                        (totalling $17.9 million), but was billed by only a small proportion of physicians (roughly 2%
                        of physicians accounted for 20% of total billings). The fee code was disproportionately billed
                        by physicians in team-based care (PCNs), and increased the billing of other complementary fee
                        codes by 5%-10% (or roughly $80 million). The results suggest the unintended consequences of
                        a well-intentioned policy can be costly.

                        In this study, we investigate whether an aging workforce affects the job opportunities of youth.  Provincial data from the 1976-2013 Labour Force Surveys and a fixed-effects model is used to estimate the effect of the share of the adult male labour force that is aged 55 to 69 on the employment and unemployment rates of men aged 25 to 29.  We estimate effects on other labour market outcomes including wages and school enrolment, and other samples of younger men and women.  There is no evidence to suggest that a growing share of older workers negatively affects the decisions or outcomes of youth in the labour market.  To the contrary, there is weak evidence to suggest an aging population has a positive effect on the labour market outcomes of youth.

                        Under the flexible exchange rate regime, the Canadian economy is constantly affected
                        by fluctuations in exchange rates. This paper focuses on the employment effect
                        of the exchange rate in Canada. We find that appreciations of the Canadian dollar
                        have signicant effects on employment in manufacturing industries; such effects
                        are mostly associated with the export-weighted exchange rate and not the import-weighted
                        exchange rate. Meanwhile, the exchange rate has little effect on jobs in
                        nonmanufacturing industries. Because the manufacturing sector accounts for only
                        about 10% of the employment in Canada, the overall employment effect of the exchange
                        rate is small. In addition, we quantify the loss of manufacturing employment
                        associated with a boom in the commodity market during which the Canadian dollar
                        tends to appreciate. Our estimates suggest that when commodity prices increase by
                        15.77% (one standard deviation of annual change in commodity price between 1994
                        and 2010), Canada's manufacturing employment decreases by 0.8%, about 0.08% of
                        the total employment.

This paper estimates macroeconomic models for Canada to investigate the relationship between changes in non-price lending standards, business loans and output. We allow for the possibility that macroeconomic and financial market conditions in the U.S. affect those in Canada. The responses to financial shocks are dissimilar in both countries. Real time data are also found to have a significant impact on the results. The U.S. and Canada may indeed be likened to 'two solitudes' insofar as the impact of credit conditions is concerned. Differences in the quality of banking standards and supervision of financial institutions, as well differences in the effectiveness of monetary policies in the two countries may partially explain the results.

                        Monetary policy decisions are typically taken after a committee has deliberated and voted on a proposal. However, there are well-known risks associated with committee-based decisions. In this paper we examine the record of the shadow Monetary Policy Council in Canada. Given the structure of the committee, how decision-making takes place, as well as the voting arrangements, the MPC does not face the same information cascades and group polarization risks faced by actual decision-makers in central bank monetary policy councils. We find a considerable diversity of opinion about the recommended future path of interest rates inside the MPC. Beginning with the explicit forward guidance provided by the Bank of Canada market determined forward rates diverge considerably from the recommendations implied by the MPC. There is little evidence that the Bank and the MPC coordinate their future views about the interest rate path. However, it is difficult to explain the basis on which median voter inside the MPC, as well as doves and hawks on the committee, change their views about future changes in policy rates. This implies that there remain challenges in understanding the evolution of future interest rate paths over time.

With a sample of US banks from 2002 to 2010, we find that the inclusion of female executives increases bank performance after addressing endogeneity and reverse causality issues. We also provide evidence that female executives decrease the risk taking of banks. These results suggest that there is added value to having female executives on the executive team. We also find that a more balanced gender ratio results in a greater impact on bank performance and risk taking. This supports the argument to increase gender diversity in executive level positions for females.

                        The elderly are the most intensive users of healthcare including prescription drugs. Canadian provinces have responded with varying levels of support through senior drug plans that use cost-sharing measures such as co-payments in an attempt to find a sustainable balance between health objectives and budgetary constraints. While provincial co-payments have tended to migrate upwards over time resulting in a greater financial burden for seniors, Saskatchewan deviated from this trend in 2007 by capping its co-payment level. In an effort to provide evidence-based research to the ongoing policy discussion on best-practice approaches for this relatively vulnerable population group, this paper employs a Difference-in-Difference method within a Generalized Linear Model (GLM) to examine the impacts of the Saskatchewan policy change on out-of-pocket expenditure for senior household with a focus on impacts for differing segments of expenditure. The findings suggest the Saskatchewan policy change resulted in a decrease in out-of-pocket expenditures thereby lowering the financial burden for seniors. The results also show the expenditure savings largely accrued to seniors at the higher level of expenditure distribution and the policy change did not result in any significant change for households in the middle and lower quintiles.

                         This paper explores the effects of price limits on the Chinese A-share stock markets during financial crises. A Logit regression model is estimated to investigate the characteristics of stocks that hit the price limits more frequently under economic turmoil. It is found that the price limit system increased volatility significantly, especially in the downward price movement. Moreover, price limit delays the efficient price discovery for upward and downward price movements. Finally, actively traded stocks with a higher positive correlation with the entire market in the property industry hit the price limits more frequently.

                        In the aftermath of the recent debt crisis, many countries are implementing nonlinear fiscal policy rules, 
                        whereby the government’s responsiveness to debt must strengthen at higher levels of debt. 
                        This paper examines how a nonlinear fiscal policy rule affects the possibility of future insolvency in a small open economy. 
                        We find that (1) the criteria for a nonlinear fiscal rule to eliminate explosive behavior should be tighter than the ones 
                        proposed by Bohn (1998); (2) a country that adopts a nonlinear fiscal rule could substantially reduce the probability of a solvency crisis; 
                        (3) a nonlinear fiscal rule allows a country to reduce the possibility of insolvency without large initial responsiveness.	</td>

                        In this report we provide 2014 estimates of the male-female gap in average hourly wages for private sector Ontario workers aged 20-59, using the 2014 Labour Force Survey.  We decompose the wage gap to describe the extent to which the gap reflects gender differences in observable characteristics and the extent to which the gap is unexplained.
                        Overall, the average wage of Ontario women in the private sector was 81.4% of the average wage of Ontario men in the private sector.  A large portion of the gap (44%) reflects gender difference in industry and occupation, but 56% remains unexplained.
